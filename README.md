### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Santhush

I'm an Engineering graduate at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, with around 1 years experience in embeded systems, Web & desktop applications & machine development.

The world is evolving rapidly with digital applications making people lives much more easier & interesting. I personally enjoy these new technologies & contributing with cloud based applications & systems. Apart from that I play Valorant & like to do community work. Looking to learn more about ML in near future.
