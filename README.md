### Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Santhush..

I'm an Engineering graduate at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, with about 2 years experience in Web & desktop applications, embeded systems & machine development.

The world is evolving rapidly with digital applications making people lives much more easier & interesting. I personally enjoy these new technologies & contributing with cloud based applications & systems. Apart from that I play Valorant & like to do community work. Looking to learn more about ML in near future.
